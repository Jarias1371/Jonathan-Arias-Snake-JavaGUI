# Jonathan-Arias-Snake-JavaGUI


This project was a tutorial that I followed and created to better understand how the GUI in Java works. We didn't cover the GUI in Java during our first module so I wanted to craete something with it just to have a base level of understanding. The game plays as the original snake game and has a score counter and tracker similar to the flappy bird JS project.
